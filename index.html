      <div class ="content">  <h1>Smash Bros. Tier List</h1>
        <h2>Welcome to our site!</h2>
        <p>The super smash tiers is a list that ranks all of the characters based on their strength,
            fighting abilities, and their potential. There is a tier list for each game: Super Smash
            Bros, Super Smash Melee, Super Smash Brawl, Super Super Smash Bros.4, and Super Smash
            Bros. Ultimate. The tiers are ranked starting with an SS tier, the best tier which is
            followed by an S tier which is then followed by tiers A to F, F being the worst tier.
            Tiers are most commonly used for players who compete at the competitive level. They are
            a way to find out the likelihood of a player’s victory. However, a player's skill is not
            factored into the equation. That means a player playing as an F ranked character can
            still beat an SS ranked character, although it’s not likely and may be harder.</p>
       <p> Our
        goal was to make a site that held tier rankings for every character in each Super Smash
        game. We wanted to show their tiers in a way that was easy to visualize so that anyone can
        understand the rankings, even if they have never played the game before. Feel free to browse our site, we hope you learn something new about Super Smash tiers!</p> <p>We are at <a
